	abstract = {PyMC is a probabilistic programming library for Python that provides tools for constructing and fitting Bayesian models. It offers an intuitive, readable syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. PyMC leverages the symbolic computation library PyTensor, allowing it to be compiled into a variety of computational backends, such as C, JAX, and Numba, which in turn offer access to different computational architectures including CPU, GPU, and TPU. Being a general modeling framework, PyMC supports a variety of models including generalized hierarchical linear regression and classification, time series, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and non-parametric models such as Gaussian processes (GPs). We demonstrate PyMC's versatility and ease of use with examples spanning a range of common statistical models. Additionally, we discuss the positive role of PyMC in the development of the open-source ecosystem for probabilistic programming.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous understanding of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

	title = {Introducing {Monte} {Carlo} {Methods} with {R}},
	abstract = {Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis \{\vphantom{\}}Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

	url = {https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net},
	abstract = {The intensification in the frequency and intensity of short-duration rainfall worldwide has led to increased infrastructure damage from urban pluvial flooding. In the Southeastern United States, where short-duration convective storms are closely linked to urban flooding, we need to better explore trends in short-duration extreme rainfall, to update design rainfall estimates or depth-duration-frequency (DDF) values over short durations. Research on trends in short-duration (especially sub-hourly) rainfall in the US is limited. Most existing studies emphasize frequency trends rather than magnitude, typically analyzing daily or monthly rainfall totals, or else events exceeding specific thresholds, which are less relevant for urban flooding concerns. Few investigations have explored trends in DDF values for short durations, leading to inconsistent findings influenced by statistical approaches, choice of metrics, and assumptions. This study analyzes rainfall data from 473 stations in the Southeastern US, with temporal resolutions of 15 minutes (326 gauges) and 1 minute (147 gauges). We conduct various trend tests on rainfall statistics, including maxima for durations from 5 minutes to 6 hours, to examine the power of different methodologies in detecting trends. By fitting maxima series to extreme value models for non-stationary sequences and performing spatial trend tests, we aim to identify patterns that can provide insights into rainfall trends. Moreover, we highlight the subjectivity in the different methods, addressing the gap in extreme rainfall trend analysis over short durations, thus contributing to more informed urban drainage system design in response to climate change.},
